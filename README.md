Todo:

- add "leaderboard"/attempt tracker panel
  - display time taken, win/loss, board size
  - sort by datetime played, time taken
  - filter by board size
- create seeding system (sequence of numbers creates a valid minesweeper board)
- make it impossible to select text within the board
- implement left and right click on square (FOR AUTHENTICITY!!!)
